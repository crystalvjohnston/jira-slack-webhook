Jira/Slack integration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crystalvjohnston/jira-slack-webhook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crystalvjohnston/jira-slack-webhook)

---

To run:
#install dependencies 
npm install

#run the application
npm run dev

---

The project is currently host on Heroku, this is where the Slack URL is defined.

If running locally, the port will also need to be defined.

Jira Issue objects can be put into Swagger (http://localhost:[port]/api-docs/) to be tested. Samples of this can be found in the mockdata folder.
